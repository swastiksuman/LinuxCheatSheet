/ Root Directory


/bin Essential User binaries


/boot Static Boot Files

Files Needed to boot the system. Boot loader configuration isn't located here, they're in /etc folder with other configuration files.

/dev Device Files

Linux exposes devices as files. These aren't actual files, but they appear as files. For eg, /dev/sda represents the first SATA drive in system.

/etc Configuration Files

The /etc directory contains configuration files, which can generally be edited by hand in a text editor. Note that the /etc/ directory contains system-wide configuration files – user-specific configuration files are located in each user’s home directory.

/root – Root Home Directory

The /root directory is the home directory of the root user. Instead of being located at /home/root, it’s located at /root. This is distinct from /, which is the system root directory.
